        <h2>Preparing for your learning journey</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Know your why.</strong> Congratulations on making the first
            step to becoming a Software Developer! Knowing the reason
            <em>why</em> you are choosing to go down this learning path to gain
            these valuable skills will keep you from burning out when it gets
            tough. Hold on to that why!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Make a plan.</strong> Stay in control of your learning
            outcomes by planning properly. Identify any blockers that may keep
            you from being successful these next several months and remove them
            <em>before</em> you begin your learning journey.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Master your tools.</strong> One of the biggest blockers a
            new software developer has is being unfamiliar with their computer
            and it's operating system. Get to know all of the tools you plan on
            working with while making software. This includes your web browser,
            the terminal, and any collaboration tools such as messaging
            platforms and GitHub.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>During your learning journey</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rely on your peers.</strong> Not completely, but don't be an
            island. Your peers are your biggest asset and you are an asset to
            them. Plus who knows, you may be working alongside each other one
            day.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ask for help.</strong> If you are paying for help, use it!
            Don't let yourself get stuck on a problem for more than 15 minutes.
            Your instructors/tutors will be more than happy to help you and it's
            likely they've already solved the problem you are working through
            before. Don't be afraid of asking other developers you don't know
            for help, either. You may be surprised by the positive responses
            you'll get.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learn how to research.</strong> Often times there will be
            problems that you run into where it is really vague what to search
            for in your search engines. Be resourceful. Keep a list of things
            you know, and things you don't know. Always be researching the
            things you don't know until you know them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overall tips for success</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Silence is a setback.</strong> Engage with your peers.
            Celebrate your wins, talk about your struggles, and always ask
            questions. Try it, you won't regret it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Embrace failure.</strong> There's going to be days that
            don't go as expected. That's just how it goes when learning
            something new. Reflect on your perceived failures and use them as a
            learning experience.

            <blockquote>
              “Success is most often achieved by those who don't know that
              failure is inevitable.”
            </blockquote>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drink water.</strong> Seriously! Your brain composed of 73%
            water and it's going to be working overtime, requiring more hydration
            than usual. More importantly, look after your overall health. Take
            time for walks daily. Stretch during breaks. Get quality time with
            humans you love. Get enough sleep.
